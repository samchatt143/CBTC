It is a directory which is maintained for the CIPHERBYTE TECHNOLOGIES internship.
There were many tasks present, I completed two tasks...
One is the WEATHERVUE(Weather-App) using HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT...which at first having a space where user can enter the location and just after clicking the "search" button...My API will fetch the weather details for the location user wanted to know.
Another is the EMPORIFYX(E-Commerce Website) using HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT which would at first show a pop up dialog which would let the user know about the DISCOUNT our website is providing currently and then there are HOME...SHOP,etc. options. Also one can check our DUMMY BILL which is generated at our cart page.
